<h1>Student Posters</h1>

<p>The International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization (CGO) provides a premier venue to 
bring together researchers and practitioners working on feedback-directed optimization and back-end 
compilation techniques. The conference covers optimization for parallelism, performance, power, and 
security, where that optimization occurs in the mapping from an input (including APIs, high-level 
languages, byte codes such as .NET or Java, or ISAs) to a similar or lower-level target machine 
representation.</p>

<p>Undergraduate and graduate students are encouraged to submit posters to CGO 2011 pertaining to 
research topics relevant to CGO (see the Call for Papers for a list of relevant topics). Posters 
provide an excellent opportunity for short presentations and informal discussions with CGO attendees. 
Posters will be displayed during a poster session, giving presenters a chance to showcase their latest 
results and innovations.  New this year, an award will be given to the best poster at the conference.</p>

<p>A submission must include an abstract of up to 400 words. Including a rough sketch of the poster is 
recommended. Also include a URL of a web site related to the poster, if applicable. Poster submissions 
are now being accepted.</p>

<p><b>Submissions can be emailed to the Student Poster Chair, <a href="mailto:nvachhar@gmail.com">Neil Vachharajani</a></b></p>

<p>Students are encouraged to create 36"x48" laminated posters (e.g., FedEx/Kinkos ). Alternately, for 
students wishing to construct posters from standard sheets of paper, we will provide a blank 36"x48" 
poster board and glue (upon request) before the presentation session.</p>

<p><b>Submission Deadline: March 25, 2011</b><br>
Notification of Decision: within 48 hours of submission
