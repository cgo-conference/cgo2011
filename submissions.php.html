<h3>Detailed Submission Guidelines</font></H3>
</a>


<p>Please make sure that your paper satisfies ALL of the following requirements
before it is submitted.  </p>

<ul>

<li>The paper must be original material that has not been previously
   published in another conference or journal, nor is currently under
   review by another conference or journal. Note that you may submit
   material presented previously at a workshop without copyrighted
   proceedings. </li>

<li> Your submission is limited to <b><u><i>ten</i></u></b> (10) 8.5"x11"
single spaced, double-column pages, using 10pt or larger font. The page limit
includes everything: references, title, figures, appendices, abstract, etc.  We
highly recommend the <a
href="http://www.sigplan.org/authorInformation.htm">templates</a> provided by
SIGPLAN.  Submissions not adhering to these submission guidelines may be
outright rejected at the discretion of the program chairs. (Please make sure
your paper prints satisfactorily on 8.5"x11" paper: this is especially
important for submissions from countries where A4 paper is standard.)</li>

<li> Papers are to be submitted for <u><i><b>double-blind review</b></i></u>. 
Blind reviewing of papers will be done by the program committee, assisted by 
outside referees. Author names as well as hints of identity are to be removed 
from the submitted paper. Use care in naming your files. Source file names, 
e.g., Joe.Smith.dvi, are often embedded in the final output as readily 
accessible comments.
<p>In addition, do not omit references to provide anonymity, as this leaves the 
reviewer unable to grasp the context. Instead, if you are extending your own 
work, you need to reference and discuss the past work in third person, as if you 
were extending someone else's research. We realize in doing this that for some 
papers it will still be obvious who the authors are. In this case, the 
submission will not be penalized as long a concerted effort was made to 
reference and describe the relationship to the prior work as if you were 
extending someone else's research. For example, if your name is Joe Smith: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">In previous work [1,2], Smith presented a 
  new branch predictor for ....&nbsp; In this paper, we extend their work by ...</font></p>
  <p><font face="Courier New" size="2">Bibliography<br>

  [1] Joe Smith, &quot;A Simple Branch Predictor for&nbsp; ...,&quot; Proceedings of 
  CGO 
  2004.<br>

  [2] Joe Smith, &quot;A More Complicated Branch Predictor for...,&quot; Proceedings of 
  CGO 2004.</font> </p>
</blockquote></li>

<li>Please identify any PC member with whom there is a conflict of interest using
the Groups feature of the EasyChair submission page.</li>
   
<li> Your submission must be formatted for black-and-white printers and
   not color printers. This is especially true for plots and graphs in
   the paper.</li>

<li> Please make sure that the labels on your graphs are readable without
   the aid of a magnifying glass. Typically the default font sizes on
   the graph axes in a program like Microsoft Excel are too small.</li>

<li> Please number the pages.</li>

<li> The paper must be submitted in PDF. We cannot accept any other
   format, and we must be able to print the document just as we
   receive it. We strongly suggest that you use only the four
   widely-used printer fonts: Times, Helvetica, Courier and Symbol. </li>
   

<li>Please make sure that the output has been formatted for printing on LETTER 
  size paper. If generating the paper using &quot;dvips&quot;, use the option &quot;-P cmz -t 
  letter&quot;, and if that is not supported, use &quot;-t letter&quot;.
</li>

</ul>
